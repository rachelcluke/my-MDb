#myMDB (Movie Tracker) Website

<!--[Am I responsive - myMDB](docs/XXX "Am I responsive")-->

# Project Overview

Welcome,

This is myMDb ("my MDb") website, a full-stack site for movie enthusiasts to search, track and review movies they have watched. They will also be able to view what movies other members have been watching. This is Rachel Luke's submission for Code Institute's Backend Development Milestone.

The following are high-level details of this project:

-  This is a relational database backed Flask project for a web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records on movies they have watched.
- The main technologies used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask and PostgreSQL.
- The project demonstrates backend development web design.
- User functionality is intuitive to users (to create, locate, display, edit and delete records).
- The site has a main navigation in the header and a structured layout.
- Git & GitHub are used for version control.
- Any external code sources used in the project are clearly identified in the code itself and in this README.md file
- The final version has been deployed via GitHub Pages.
- There are no passwords or secret keys in the project repository.

# UI / Design Choices

## Moodboard

One of the first milestones of this project was to create a moodboard to help envision the overall house style of the webiite and ensure that all of the sections and elements are cohesive. The software I used to create the moodboard for this website is [Mila Note](https://milanote.com/ "Mila Note").
Below, is the moodboard:

## Fonts

## Icons

## Colours

The colour scheme of the website is inspired by the moodboard (previously depicted). I have used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/ "coolers") to retrieve the desired colour codes and generate the colour palette.

Below, is the color palette:

## Media Queries

As a starting point, I have designed this website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. Then I created 3 additional media queries for largers devices listed below.

| Screen Size |  Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| mobile      |  <320px     |
| tablet      |  => 768px   |
| laptop      |  => 1920px  |
| desktop     |  => 2560px  |
